# Amazon Delivery Time Prediction

This project develops a machine learning model to predict delivery time for e-commerce orders based on order attributes, agent details, traffic, weather, and geolocation data.

---

## Objective
To build a reliable prediction system that improves delivery time estimation and supports logistics decision-making.

---

## Key Activities
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering (distance, time features, categorical encoding)  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Regression model development (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)  
- Model performance tracking using MLflow  
- Deployment of a Streamlit-based prediction interface  

---

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- MLflow  
- Streamlit
